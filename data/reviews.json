    "Review": "Well… What I picked up from this film was unlike any other superhero movie I’ve ever seen, which is important to celebrate considering the endlessly-regurgative Marvel hell we’ve found ourselves enslaved to. Unfortunately, the cinematography and special effects were… wrong, somehow. I say so with no small amount of caution - I don’t want to condemn a single filmmaking decision simply because it’s different from what I’m used to. Again - considering that films have become such stagnant, digestible products - <i>any</i> sort of genuine originality and/or innovation in the process of a major title’s production should be praised… dare I say it… even if it’s just…bad.\r\n\r\nI did <i>not</i> really give <i>Aquaman</i> my full attention, though, nor have I read anything else about it. I guess I hope some folks loved it for its particular departures in that way which makes films truly special in their memory.",

    "Review": "Regardless of how you feel about her music, pop music in general, the music industry, pop culture, or just about any of the context adjacent to this documentary, there are a few things about it I hold as Universal Truths:\r\n\r\n1. It is without a doubt the best content on Apple TV+.\r\n\r\n2. Billie Eilish is one cool kid with a good creative eye and select hard-hitting wisdom.\r\n\r\n3. Billie *gave a lot of herself* to this film - in the common sense of the idiom, yes - if that makes sense. I'm appreciative of this because I feel like I gained quite a bit from it.\r\n\r\n4. Qualitatively, as an entertainment product *and* a creative, curated, and considered work, it performs its function exceptionally. I'm not sure I've seen such a poignant encapsulation of this moment in history from pop culture,  yet - something I would expect to make 8th grade history students watch in 40 years. \r\n\r\nI suspect it was a lot of fucking work, as well, given how much appears to be cut from static cameras just left taping in Billie's home. I've sat in front of enough video editing work for enough cumulative lifetime hours to understand and appreciate the shear amount of energy it requires from a person.\r\n\r\nI'm very glad I took the \"chance\" to give it a try, despite my assumptions. You should, too, no matter who you are. Bravo!",

    "Review": "<strong>Examining Fred Rogers' debut Atlantic-theatre naval anxiety compilation.</strong>\r\n<p>It&#39;s a little late to write about <a href='https://letterboxd.com/film/greyhound/'><em>Greyhound</em></a> - Tom Hanks&#39; <a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/#writer'>first screenwriting credit</a> - which released <a href='https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/greyhound/umc.cmc.o5z5ztufuu3uv8lx7m0jcega'>on Apple TV+</a> this past Father&#39;s Day, June 21st. Though I definitely left my quite severe obsession with WWII history in my prepubescence, I thought I&#39;d remark on this film because I originally hoped it would fulfill a role I&#39;d long wanted for: the destroyer-side compliment to U-boat films like <a href='https://letterboxd.com/film/das-boot/'><em>Das Boot</em></a> and <a href='https://letterboxd.com/film/u-571/'><em>U-571</em></a>. James D. Hornfischer&#39;s exceptional account of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413)'>U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts</a>&#39; part in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar'>The Battle off Samar</a> with <a href='http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/82865'><em>The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors</em></a> was my last dive into naval history. It&#39;s one of the most astounding war stories I&#39;ve ever encountered, and upon first seeing <a href='https://youtu.be/eyzxu26-Wqk'><em>Greyhound</em>&#39;s trailer</a>, I was sortof hoping it was the Big Boy film adaptation its always warranted. (Though apparently there was a <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068999/'>TV movie</a> made in 2005???) Instead, its based on (distinct from &quot;adapted from,&quot; apparently) a 1955 novel by English author C.S. Forester entitled <a href='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260852968364965888/737932123159265300/The_Good_Shepherd_-_C.S._Forester.pdf'><em>The Good Shepherd</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Tom Hanks made sure to imbue his first screenplay with a <em>shitload</em> of &quot;<a href='https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/greyhound-review-tom-hanks-second-world-war-film'>opaque naval jargon</a>,&quot; as <em>The Guardian</em>&#39;s Peter Bradshaw&#39;s review put it. A brief <a href='https://www.thecinemaholic.com/greyhound-ship-world-war-ii/'>&quot;investigation&quot; by <em>The Cinemaholic</em></a> suggests that the U.S.S. Keeling - the film&#39;s singular setting - most resembles a <a href='http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/'><em>Mahan</em>-class destroyer</a>, though none actually bore the name. For the actual photography, the production made use of a surviving example of the <a href='http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/'>most mass-produced destroyer</a> of all time:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>When it came to shooting the film, instead of relying completely on sets, the crew of ‘Greyhound’ found another option. They used USS Kidd, a real WWII destroyer, to film the journey of Greyhound. She is a Fletcher-class destroyer and is named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first US flag officer to die during the Second World War.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>As much as you&#39;re going to loathe it, I must include this commentary on <em>Greyhound</em>&#39;s historical accuracy if only because - as a undoubtedly mainstream film - its been so widely and competently reviewed, already, by real film writers. I am almost positive U-boats would rarely - if ever - waste their precious few viable torpedo shots firing ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and destroyer escorts that protected supply convoys, and I am <em>sure</em> that none ever bothered with <em>audibly addressing enemy ships</em> over the radio in English. I understand that dramatizing historic events is the core function of <em>Greyhound</em>&#39;s genre, but this particular addition was so unbearably cheesy that it utterly decimates all of the experience&#39;s hard-won context. Just look at a snippet from the first of two dialogues in text:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.</p>\r\n<p>This is Gray Wolf.</p>\r\n<p>We hunt you and your friends\r\nEagle, Dicky and Harry.</p>\r\n<p>We watch your ships sinking into the deep.</p>\r\n<p>We hear the screams of your comrades\r\nas they die.</p>\r\n<p>How many of them will there be\r\nbefore you join them?</p>\r\n<p>The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s an essential academic film function which only similar enemy taunts could perform and without which this screenplay would&#39;ve been <em>technically</em> unsound, and - if I were allowed supposition - I would venture to guess that America&#39;s Favorite Dad felt pressured to bolster his first penning against easy gimmes for the Great Big institution of cinema criticism as much as possible. <em>However</em>, this shit is just disruptingly cheesy. Fuck it! Have the rest:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Greyhound!</p>\r\n<p>Your flock is not safe from this wolf.</p>\r\n<p>We can always find you\r\nin the night to kill you.</p>\r\n<p>Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?</p>\r\n<p>[Gray Wolf howls]</p>\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n<p>Greyhound.</p>\r\n<p>Guten Morgen, Greyhound.</p>\r\n<p>Did you think you had slipped away\r\nfrom this Gray Wolf?</p>\r\n<p>No, you did not. You will not.</p>\r\n<p>The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,\r\nnot the hound on the run.</p>\r\n<p>You and your comrades will die today.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The contrast with the rest of the script&#39;s imposingly thorough and relentlessly-paced naval action dialogue is far too abrupt to <em>not</em> be problematic. Even as obsessed as I was with naval history, I&#39;m still too oblivious to the details of what is/was actually said on the bridge of a warship during combat maneuvers to tell you how authentic <em>Greyhound</em>&#39;s depiction really is (it&#39;s hardly ever shown on the screen or laid out in nonfiction, even,) which nullifies all relevance the realism would&#39;ve had, otherwise. Director Aaron Schneider in <a href='https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/07/greyhound-movie-tom-hanks-aaron-schneider'>an interview for <em>Vanity Fair</em></a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>“If you decide to read <em>Greyhound</em> by tracking the dialogue—rudder commands and sonar distances—you’ll soon find yourself completely lost. Because that’s not where the movie lives. This screenplay was designed to beam you aboard the USS <em>Keeling</em>…and it’s up to you to engage with what’s going on and extrapolate how things work, so you can answer the question, ‘What the hell is going on here?’&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In this sense - crafting a consuming, believable, unbelievably gray, claustrophobic, icing iron reality - Tom Hanks excels.</p>\r\n<p>Though Letterboxd user <a href='https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/'>brucewayn</a> called it &quot;boring&quot; in <a href='https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/film/greyhound/'>the most popular review of the film</a> to date on the platform, I found <em>Greyhound</em> to be quite engaging in an anxious, depressing sense familiar to classic war dramas like <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> and <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. The tedium of naval warfare&#39;s endless orienteering is rescaled to a battlefield of lesser distances - axis and allied vessels actually collide on several occasions and a U-boat crew decides to <em>fuck it all</em> and brawl it out with two parallel destroyers with surface guns instead of retreating after losing their ability to dive. (See: <a href='https://youtu.be/4uOcE_IIi30'><em>Titanic VI</em></a>.) Through a combination of wartime compression and stitching, <em>Greyhound</em> is in large part a mashup of naval action at the extremes of what historical fiction will allow within its 48-hour setting. From Ben Lindbergh&#39;s <a href='https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/7/9/21318481/tom-hanks-greyhound-review'>review for <em>The Ringer</em></a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>In <em>The Good Shepherd</em>, enemy torpedoes simply sail wide; in the movie, they graze the hull for even closer calls. In the book, Krause agonizes over, and generally resists, calling the crew to general quarters, wary of exhausting their energy reserves; in the movie, he doesn’t hesitate to summon his sailors to battle stations.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The result is an emotionally effective film constrained by a very specific dramatic aim: another war movie every father can juice for decades&#39; worth of Sunday afternoons on the sofa. &quot;As befits his status as America&#39;s Dad, Hanks has constructed for us the ultimate Dad Movie — all the action you could ever need or want, with no annoying characters hanging around, harboring pesky needs and wants of their own,&quot; <a href='https://www.npr.org/2020/07/10/888899608/world-war-ii-naval-drama-greyhound-charts-a-trim-efficient-course'>quips Glen Weldon for <em>NPR</em></a>. Undoubtedly, though, the subject matter is fresh. I wouldn&#39;t say my youth desire for a surface-side Atlantic-theatre film is 100% satiated, but <em>Greyhound</em> managed to accomplish much more than I expected.</p>",

    "Review": "<b>This bit originally appeared on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/redbillboards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extratone</a>.</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may be the time to jab at the rural, working-class South, but Martin McDonagh claims to have written his Golden Orb Special “eight years ago,” long before Tump, and any critical resolution the film provides is argued haphazardly. Consequently, its eye is cast on this strange, satirical portrayal of the Midwest in a manner which is inaccurate and insensitive enough to irk this Missourian. When I saw it at Columbia’s Ragtag Cinema this week, it was introduced by a young employee who noted that 1) Ebbing, Missouri is not a real place, 2) the film was actually shot in one of the Carolinas (an audience member suggested incorrectly that it was in SC,) and 3) we should prepare ourselves to be roused a bit by a bar scene in which a character pays $8 for two beers because “that just wouldn’t happen” (the Ragtag also serves alcohol.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “redemption arc” of the racist “hick” “loser” Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) was rightfully <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/19/16878018/three-billboards-controversy-racist-sam-rockwell-redemption-flannery-oconnor\" rel=\"nofollow\">at the center</a> of the film’s controversy, but even if one imagines his role and fate written differently - perhaps with him irrecoverably shunned and/or visibly punished for his excessive, hateful violence - his rubishness would still be unforgivable. Living with his mother and turtle feels like an effort to humanize him - and, by extension, racist small-town cops as a whole. The Huffington Post’s Zeba Blay wrote an <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-critics-three-billboards-racism_us_5a3135eae4b091ca268479f3\" rel=\"nofollow\">essential take</a> on why Three Billboards - with its terrifyingly racist dork - was received the way it was.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Rockwell’s character is the racist uncle whom white liberals fear and love. The ability to feel for him ― to root for him in spite of his past transgressions, because he really is a “good man at heart,” an idiot who doesn’t know any better ― offers a kind of catharsis for the white viewer who can’t or won’t deal with true nuance, who is unable to reconcile their own complicity with their desire to be “good.”</blockquote>It’s not as if the film isn’t technically well executed or refreshing - thanks in large part, yes, to Frances McDormand - or that I will not regret appealing on behalf of my home state, but it’s hard not to speak up when Hollywood shits so recklessly on my people. I don’t much like writing about movies because there are so many voices who consistently speak so much more effectively. NPR’s Pop Culture Happy Hour, for instance, did a wonderful job <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/12/01/567291457/pop-culture-happy-hour-revenge-redemption-and-three-billboards\" rel=\"nofollow\">dissecting</a> the film’s depictions of racism and domestic violence. Gene Demby commented that “[McDonagh] doesn’t get these particular physics of American racism, and he’s not interested in them,” and I think it’s reasonable to suggest that Mark’s not very versed or interested in the physics of American class, either.\r\n\r\nIf you must differentiate the state of Missouri as a cultural whole between North and South, it is currently more red than blue - we went 56% for Donald and 38% for Hillary - but ask anyone from “somewhere down in the Georgia, Florida, Alabama corner” - as McDonagh put it - where we generally fall, and they’d be unlikely to regard us, fraternally, as the same part of the country. The accents in Three Billboards are not among the wide variety of local dialects you’ll encounter anywhere in the state, but perhaps they wouldn’t be out of place in Sylva, North Carolina, where the film was <a href=\"http://wlos.com/news/local/big-movie-comes-to-sylva-shooting-dates-for-three-billboards\" rel=\"nofollow\">actually shot</a>.\r\n\r\nRegardless of all potential criticism of the film’s cultural perspective or technical excellence - and I think most of it is more valid than any take I could possibly offer - my particular issue with it comes from a culmination of tasteless decisions. If one reasonably successful Irish director were to produce a patronizing film at the expense of Missouri’s working class filled with a ton of absurd, misconstrued characters portrayed by A-list talent on location in a real Missouri town, the side-effectual economic benefits such a production delivers to a locale would make it all more forgivable. Say what you want about us… as long as you’re paying. But to photograph such a film completely separate Missouri - culturally and financially - set in a fictional(ized) town, include the state’s name in its title, before conducting oneself in interviews as if we were a random target on a “Southern” dartboard… Well, that’s awfully shitty.\r\n\r\nBoy, working class Americans sure are a riot!\r\n\r\nThe writing is interesting enough for this, totally-out-of-touch “reviewer,” but I can’t imagine why it won Best Screenplay at the Globes, unless the other nominees were completely, bleakly predictable. (I wouldn’t know.) <a href=\"http://extratone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cock.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">This excerpt</a> was the most stirring part of the experience, personally, if only because I really like films that palm strike one in the face without warning with bizarre, chaotic vulgarity (like the elevator scene in Drive.)\r\n \r\nI suppose it could have been the result of a rational decision to give any depth to Anne (Abbie Cornish) - who is Chief Willoughby’s (Woody Fucking Harrelson) Australian?, much-too-attractive wife - before he kills himself in the last third of the movie, making her suddenly relevant. Or, perhaps it was another attempt to emphasize the emotional repression of “Southern” folks - one of the almost-accurate positives of the film, if only thanks to McDormand’s skill. She and Sam Rockwell won Best Actress and Best Actor in a Supporting Role, respectively, which makes sense - it’s a shame they accepted such an out-of-touch work with which to demonstrate their ability to assume aloof, emotionally-dysfunctional characters.\r\n\r\nGrowing up astride classes while traveling throughout the vast majority of Missouri for various reasons has made me defensive, and - while my right to speak for hard-working Midwesterners is certainly debatable - I’d suggest the industry at large be more diligently interested when setting is especially emphasized. It is no longer acceptable to pass up the opportunities McDonagh has for critical storytelling in Three Billboards. Racist cops, abusive spouses, unsolved murders, and mishandled grief are real, abundant issues in the country’s breadbasket, and they’re worth discussing responsibly - especially with such a powerful platform. If the purpose of film writing is to help an audience determine whether or not a work is worth spending their time and money to see it in theaters or otherwise, I can tell you - even within my bias and limited authority - that this one just… isn’t.",

    "Review": "<i><a href=\"http://bit.ly/redmom\" rel=\"nofollow\">Published on Extratone.</a></i>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earth will reach its maximum occupancy load (12 billion) when I am in my mid-fifities, meaning there’ll be more than twice as many gorging, shitting, shooting, complaining, and lying human beings than there were when I started, and perhaps Brian Taylor’s <i>Mom and Dad</i> is in fact a reasoned argument for a particular solution to our inevitable plight. I’m still not sure what a “cult” movie is, precisely, but I can’t imagine what sort of cult could possibly sustain itself around the ethos of this film alone, despite its concise, agitating, at once lighthearted, yet genuinely-disturbing trip. No, it is probably not propaganda. From the experts, you’ll get precisely the same review, varying only in length. <i>The New York Times</i>’ Glenn Kenny <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">couldn’t be bothered</a> with more than 250 words, but RogerEbert dot com’s Simon Abrams <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018\" rel=\"nofollow\">shelled out a whole 1000</a>. They are suspiciously close to these big round numbers - perhaps each was written to respective quotas, and perhaps you could say all that could reasonably be said in 10, but I don’t care. \r\n\r\nThe tropes here are polished to a miraculous sheen - two emotionally-stunted, middleaged, overly preoccupied-with-their-lost-youth suburban parents (Nicolas Cage and Selma Blair) who’s existing envies & irritations regarding their own classically bratty teenage girl (Anne Winters) and her mischievous little brother (Zackary Arthur) is merely agitated by a sudden TV static-bound killer instinct into bloodlust, not originated. I’m not sure any pill dealer would actually flip off their customers after a fair buy - even in high school, but <i>drugs</i>, a <i>black boyfriend</i>, and a <i>stinkbomb</i>? in the old Trans Am!? <i><b>I’m going to kill you!</b></i>\r\n\r\nSomebody, somewhere knew all the best sources on suburbia and how to put them to good use. The Camry, the golf bag, ping pong smashing, sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and Dr. Oz, for Christ’s sake! Granted, talking to your girlfriend/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dated - especially while riding a BMX - and I don’t think Froot Loops are generally accepted middle-class chow anymore. These are staples from <i>my</i> youth, and I am very old. Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics are more chronographically appropriate, but with great consequence, I fear - if we’re going to accept them once and for all as authentic mechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age faster than Nick’s new jowls (unless we’re all soon killed by our parents.) It’s been two years since I knew anything about music, but I seriously doubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are listening to <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/billsaberdotcom/iknowupussiesdontwantit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Father-esque post-Memphis horrorcore</a> in class - there’s something about SoundCloud that really clashes with chokers.\r\n\r\nIf there was ever a film in which to use grimy dubstep-influenced electronic slaps, buzzes, chirps, and great grating clanking, it’s this one. It’s a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly about their use of the most intimate medium. One forgets its potential to control the nuances of an audience’s fear, anger, discomfort, and panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating, distressing, ghastly gross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio production such as that of <i>Mom and Dad</i>. If you want to judge Academically the effectiveness of a nominee’s work for an award with a title like Best Sound Editing (as opposed to whatever the hell criteria was met most fully by <i>Skyfall</i>,) you must give the little golden man to <a href=\"http://extratone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/momanddadsound.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">these folks</a>, whoever they are.\r\n\r\nWhen’s the last time you saw a truly, believably shitty modern parental pair on a big screen? I really can’t remember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft - both a perfect précis and thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even <i>named</i> unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar, impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc\" rel=\"nofollow\">scream</a> it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/\" rel=\"nofollow\">memorize the entire screenplay</a> and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially “my mom is such a penis.”\r\n\r\n<i>Mom and Dad</i> could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s <i>I Am Legend</i> if for no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan - even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself <a href=\"http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/\" rel=\"nofollow\">described</a> it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying <i>National Treasure</i>, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree - this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing such boundaries is a core function of a film like <i>Mom and Dad</i>. Nobody ended up vomiting or anything.\r\n\r\nThis <i>fun</i> thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism - truly, this is a film charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) than fucking <i>Winchester</i>, which went horribly wrong, and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.) A spectacular riot, <i>Mom and Dad</i> does all you could possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it’s worth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal beads.”",

    "Review": "It could just be my total cinema illiteracy, but it’s worth noting that there are viewers (<i>American</i> viewers, no less) for whom this film does nothing at all. It’s very well shot and relatively satisfying to look at, but otherwise… not very entertaining, amusing, or frightening. Then again, I’ve spent very little of my life in proximity to the sea and even less swimming in it, and it seems as though literally everyone on Earth adores this movie? An excerpt from one of its most <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/silentdawn/film/jaws/\" rel=\"nofollow\">well-received reviews</a> on Letterbox by user <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/silentdawn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SilentDawn</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The film hits you with unmistakable bravado, class, mastery of craft, and beauty. Comedy, terror, suspense, humor, and character all combine into a film that isn't just a film. Rather its something equivalent to a cinematic milestone, where the collective audience is experiencing something different and game-changing. Jaws is beyond description, and the depths of both artistry and entertainment that it reaches is unparalleled in movie history.</blockquote>And when I thought I’d finally found <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/arielrocks5/film/jaws/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a critical review</a>, the whole thing was a gag? \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Did you guys seriously think I'd give something like this one star!? Let alone this negative of a review!? Get real guys! Hahahahah!</blockquote>And then there’s the quotes the reviewers themselves choose to pull from the film. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nimperatori/film/jaws/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nicholas Imperatori</a>’s begins with\r\n\r\n<i>“That's a twenty-footer.\"</i>\r\n<i> \"Twenty-five.\"</i>\r\n\r\nI mean… What? I kept scrubbing back and watching this snippet of dialogue a few times to figure out why it was chosen, but they are just words? Numbers? Mr. Imperatori also chose to cite <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MbeXzJDYxS0\" rel=\"nofollow\">this shot</a>, which is cool, I guess.\r\n\r\nI did not go to film school, so I’ve continued to rewatch <i>Jaws</i> every few years to see if I could possibly absorb <i>some</i> form of the democratic experience through my thick, culturally-daft skull. If I had enough money, I’d buy a bowl of adderall and pay top dollar for a film degree-wielding <i>Jaws</i> lover - or perhaps even a whole panel of them - to explain to me… to go beyond “beyond description,” if you will - why this film should matter. The overwhelmingly positive reception of the film feels like an elaborate joke on me, personally? Is there something wrong with me? Is my life at risk because I publicly expressed this opinion?",

    "Review": "<b>I wrote <i>a lot </i>about this film’s bizarrely malevolent attitude toward slavery and individual rights for <a href=\"http://bit.ly/solosw\">for <i>Extratone</i></a>, where you can read it its entirety. Below is a little excerpt about the Han Man himself.</b>\r\nIn the past, when film enthusiasts and fans have described Han Solo as “the best character in <i>Star Wars</i>,” they’ve actually been praising his potential as a character, not his material itself, and <i>Solo</i>’s most effective function as a franchise film was to shut that praise down. Han was not at all denied his movie - <i>this</i> is <i>his</i> movie - and it provided him the screentime to show us who he truly is and why we really like him so much: <b>he doesn’t fucking change</b>. The secret to Han Solo’s moral and emotional resiliency is nothing more than halted development. The same old inner conflict between the tough, ruthlessly self-interested persona he does his best to project for everyone around him and the consistent reality of his soft insides was presented in his first scene way back in 1977, and we’re now sure that he was unable to make <i>any</i> progress toward its resolution despite openly and obviously brooding over it for an entire lifetime: from at least as early as his young adulthood in this film until his death at the hands of his little Sith son. <i>There is 0 variation</i>. He <i>always</i> comes back for the cause at the crucial moment after declaring himself through with it. Without fail, he’ll sacrifice the entirety of any self-making enterprise for just about any underdog with a problem who crosses his path. (Which probably explains his constantly-fleeting success as a smuggler well into gray hair and jowls.) <i>Solo</i> is abundantly clear about Han’s true nature and very willing to expose how uninteresting it is. When he first proclaims to Qi-ra that he’s become “an outlaw,” she shuts him down with the film’s ultimate quote, insisting that she “knows who [he] really is: <i>the good guy</i>.”\r\n\r\n...<a href=\"http://bit.ly/solosw\" style=\"background-color: rgb(24, 28, 32); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">continue reading</a>",

Basically, you only need to know a few things:\r\n\r\n- At one point, they use a CREDIT CARD to plug a wound to stop the bleeding\r\n- A young woman looks back at the sinking ship from her emergency life raft boat thing and whispers \"not again.\"\r\n- There's a monologue at the beginning of the second act with so many critical mistakes that they must've had to do it in a single take.\r\n- An Australian billionaire named Clive Palmer is BUILDING A REPLICA OF THE OLD ONE RIGHT NOW CALLED TITANIC II, which overshadows this film if only because they're not even going to modernize it.\r\n- Despite all of this, Titanic 2 managed to be the Best Motion Picture of 2010.",
